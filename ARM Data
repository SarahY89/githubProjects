# Part 1 - ARM data

```{r}
arm.folding<-read.csv("arm.csv")
```

This data contains two columns only

```{r}
summary(arm.folding)
```
The two categorical variables are the gender of the participant and the arm crossed on top.

```{r}
table(arm.folding$gender, arm.folding$armcross)
```

We can test for independence using $\chi^2$, as the expected number in the cells is more than 5. 

```{r}
arm.table<-table(arm.folding$gender, arm.folding$armcross)
chisq.test(arm.table)
```

We can see from here that this is not significant.

*** 
If you wanted to run Fisher's exact:

```{r}
fisher.test(arm.table)
```

Note: it is not necessary in this case but wanted to show that it would return the similar conclusion.

# Part 2 - back to titanic

```{r}
titanic<-read.csv("titanic-all-cols.csv")
```

Recall from week 7 - we need to make sure that the data is read in correctly:

```{r}
summary(titanic)
```

We need to make sure that both Survived and Pclass are treated as categorical, so I use as.factor to make sure that is the case.

```{r}
titanic$Survived<-as.factor(titanic$Survived)
titanic$Pclass<-as.factor(titanic$Pclass)
```


Lets look at table analysis for Survived vs Pclass

Are survival status and Passenger class independent? THat is the $H_0$ that we are testing here

```{r}
table(titanic$Survived, titanic$Pclass)
```

Lets use Chisq

```{r}
chisq.test(table(titanic$Survived, titanic$Pclass))
```

We can see that there is a significant relationship between Passenger travel class and survival status. 
In other words the probability of surviviing depends on the passenger's travel class.

***

## OPTIONAL: Using the gmodels library:

The Gmodels library is useful if you are used to SAS PROC means or PROC summary.

```{r}
library(gmodels)
```


```{r}
CrossTable(titanic$Survived, titanic$Pclass, digits=2, prop.r = TRUE, prop.c = TRUE,  prop.chisq = FALSE, 
           chisq = TRUE, fisher = TRUE)
```
